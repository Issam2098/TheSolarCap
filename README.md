TheSolarCap
===========

We all use hats to protect our heads from the hot blazing sun well now you can do that and charge your mobile phones. 
I bring to you the solar cap, the solar cap is a hat that has a small flexible solar panel installed on the top of the hat 
and there is also a small USB port on the inside of that hat that is connected to the solar panel. This hat a fully 
comfortable since the USB port is covered with a thin layer of cushion. When the solar power collects the solar energy it 
needs all you do is simply take off the hat plug in your charger into the USB port and you can then charge your mobile 
phone. This hat has style, comfort, and it makes it easier for you to charger your phone when your on a hike or simply 
taking a walk in the park. I need assistants to make this product become real and this is why I am asking you to put in 
a generous contribution because it surely is not a loss of money.
